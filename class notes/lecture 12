command line tools for the midterm would be true/false or multiple choice

The performance of our protocol, we introduced sth called utilization
so as we saw with rdt 3.0 its quite terrible in terms of performance it waits a lot cuz we did this stop and wait mechanism
then we talked about two methods to overcome that to make our performance better
so the core concept of what we r talking about is pipelining we introduce more sequence numbers
once we introduced our new pipelining approach its guaranteed that the messages are arrived in order and each message indivifdually arrives
go back n:
the receiver tells the sender which number it expects
if its out of order it knows sth is messed up

the other approach we talked about:
each side is doing a bit more work
when sth arrives out of order the receiver is going to buffer those messages and then the sender keeps track of the
packets that arrived but acks did not come in order
and it had a timer for each packet

if TCP is byte stream oriented the relationship between a sequence number and an acknowledgment number is
sequence number is the byte number we r starting from
acknowledgement number is the next byte thats expected from the other side
TCP is forward duplex so both the receiver and the sender send each other data

we wanna ensure that we set an optimal timeout time
the equations for this doesn't matter (we don't go over the math in class)

TCP sender (simplified)
its gonna get an application level message and its gonna create its own segment with its seq #
if it gets an ACK and that ACK acknowledges things that it hasn't received yet it updates what is known to be ACKed

TCP flow control
ensure that the sender doesn't overwhelm the receiver
